Gatech ECE8803 FML Final Project
Introduction
This repository contains the final project for the Gatech ECE8803: Foundations of Machine Learning course, developed by Junyi Zhang, Zihan Diao, and Mingyu Zhang. The project aims to detect key biomarkers for retinal diseases, leveraging multimodal data (OCT images and clinical information). Using the OLIVES Dataset, we designed an Attention U-Net-based deep learning model to address challenges in biomarker detection.
Objective
The project focuses on the detection of four key biomarkers associated with retinal diseases:

Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)
Intraretinal Hyperreflective Foci (IRHRF)
Intraretinal Fluid (IRF)
Fully Attached Vitreous Face (FAVF)
